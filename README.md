## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App crashes on startup**
- Ensure all permissions are granted
- Check if device has internet connectivity
- Restart the app and try again

**Speed test fails**
- Check internet connection
- Try again during off-peak hours
- Ensure no other apps are using heavy bandwidth

**Ping test shows timeouts**
- Verify the hostname/IP is correct
- Check if the target is reachable from your network
- Try with different hosts

**Port scanner shows no results**
- Some networks block port scanning
- Try scanning common ports only
- Check firewall settings

### Performance Tips
- Close other apps using internet during speed tests
- Use WiFi for more accurate results
- Run tests multiple times for better accuracy
- Avoid testing during peak network usage hours
